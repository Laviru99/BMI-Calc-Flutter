# *******BMI Calculator*******

## Overview
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using Flutter. The app allows users to input their height and weight and calculates their BMI, providing a category based on their results (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese). The application is designed with a user-friendly interface that is responsive across a range of devices, adhering to Material Design guidelines.

## Features

### User Inputs
- Input height in centimeters.
- Input weight in kilograms.

### BMI Calculation
- Computes BMI using the formula:
  \[
  BMI = \frac{{\text{weight in kg}}}{{(\text{height in meters})^2}}
  \]
- Displays the BMI score and its associated category:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight

### Result Page
- After entering height and weight, users are navigated to a results page displaying:
  - The calculated BMI score.
  - The BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).
  - Tips and suggestions based on the result.

### Custom Widgets
- Modular UI built with reusable Flutter widgets for easier maintenance.
- Custom cards for input and result display, using `reusable_card.dart`.
- Icon buttons for incrementing and decrementing values.

### Attractive UI
- Follows Material Design guidelines, offering a clean and modern interface.
- Smooth animations and transitions between screens for a better user experience.

## Project Structure
